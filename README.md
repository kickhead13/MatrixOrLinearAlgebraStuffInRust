# MatrixOrLinearAlgebraStuffInRust
Rust module for matrix multiplication and matrix inversion (and maybe more in the future).
You shouldn't actually use this for anything it's just a fun thing I thought I could do since I'm trying to learn Rust, but it is not really good at what it's doing.
Still learning :) thanks!
